- x = input variable or feature

- y = output variable or target variable

- m = number of training examples

- (x,y)  = single training  example
- training set(features + targets) -> learning algorithm ->
- x -> f(model)-> y^
- for house price, size will input f is the model and price (estimation ) will be the output
- but how f will calculate. for now it will straight line
- how to representt f? fw,b(X) = wx +b or f(x)
- Linear regression with one variable(single features x or size)

- In order to implement linear regression the first key step is first to define something called a cost function.
- **The cost function will tell us how well the model is doing so that we can try to get it to do better.**

- for linear regression, squared error cost function is mostly used
