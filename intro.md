# What is machine learning
- Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without  being explicitly programmed

## Machine learning Algorithm:
### Supervised Learning
- Used most in real-world problem
- Supervised learning refers to the algorithm that learns x -> y or input to output mappings
- The key characteristic of supervised learning is you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from that include the right answer, the right answer means the correct label y for given input x
- Learn from being given "right answer"
- When you give a new data, it will predict from the learning

  Input(X)        |       Output(Y)             |        Application
  
  email           |        spam?(0/1)           |        spam filtering
  
  audio            |       text transcripts      |       speech recognition
  
  add, user info   |       click?(0/1)            |       online advertising

- **Example**:
  - **Regression**(Predict a number from infinitely many possible outputs): Housing price prediction:
    - We can predict a housing price that has the dataset like size in sqft and price in
  - **Classification**: Breast Cancer Detection
- Regression vs Classification?
